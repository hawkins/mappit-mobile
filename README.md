# Mappit Mobile

The React Native mobile app for Mappit

---

Made in 24 hours during the Hack_State 2017 Hackathon.

Features plentiful spaghetti code as Dalton and I bashed our heads against the wall with react native, expo, native base, and primitive navigation.

Powered by Firebase.

## Installing

To use the app, install the [Expo](https://expo.io/) app on your phone (see the left-hand side of the website) and then visit this link to install the app in Expo: https://exp.host/@hawkins/mappit
